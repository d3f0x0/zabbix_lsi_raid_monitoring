Monitoring raid status using sas3ircu

IR Volume State values are as follows*:
- Okay (OKY) – The volume is active and drives are functioning properly. User data is protected if the current
RAID level provides data protection.
- Degraded (DGD) – The volume is active. User data is not fully protected because the configuration has changed
or a drive has failed.
- Failed (FLD) – The volume has failed.
- Missing (MIS) – The volume is missing.
- Initializing (INIT) – The volume is initializing.
- Online (ONL) – The volume is online.
Physical device State values are as follows:
- Online (ONL) – The drive is operational and is part of a volume.
- Hot Spare (HSP) – The drive is a hot spare that is available to replace a failed drive in a volume.
- Ready (RDY) – The drive is ready for use as a normal disk drive, or it is ready to be assigned to a volume or a hot
spare pool.
- Available (AVL) – The drive might not be ready, and it is not suitable for use in a volume or a hot spare pool.
- Failed (FLD) – The drive failed and is now offline.
- Missing (MIS) – The drive has been removed or is not responding.
- Standby (SBY) – The device is not a hard-disk device.
- Out of Sync (OSY) – The drive, which is part of an IR volume, is not in sync with other drives that are part of
the volume.
- Degraded (DGD) – The drive is part of a volume and is in degraded state.
- Rebuilding (RBLD) – The drive is part of a volume and is currently rebuilding.
- Optimal (OPT) – The drive is optimal and is part of a volume.
Physical device Drive Type values are as follows:
- SAS_HDD – The drive is a SAS HDD.
- SATA_HDD – The drive is a SATA HDD.
- SAS_SSD – The drive is a SAS SSD.
- SATA_SSD – The drive is a SATA SSD.
Physical device Protocol values are as follows:
- SAS – The drive supports SAS protocol.
- SATA – The drive supports SATA protocol.
